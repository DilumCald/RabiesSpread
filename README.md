Project Title: Multi-Agent System for Rabies Spread

Project Authors: B.L.H. Randika, H.P.R.D. Caldera

Description:
This project creates a multi-agent simulation model in NetLogo to explore the interactions between different groups within a population. The model features three agent types:

People: Represent individuals with different characteristics and behaviors.
Dogs: Represent domesticated companions that interact with people and other dogs.
Antidogs: Represent individuals with strong objections to dogs, influencing their interactions with both dogs and people.

Simulation Processes:

The model simulates various processes, including:

Movement: All agents move around the environment according to their specific movement patterns and goals.
Interaction: People, dogs, and antidogs interact with each other based on their individual characteristics, social norms, and potential biases.
Influence: The actions and attitudes of agents can influence the behavior and opinions of others over time.

This project aims to:

To show the How will the model simulate the transmission of rabies between agents


Running the Model:

Download and install NetLogo.
Install any necessary extensions.
Open the model file in NetLogo.
Set the desired simulation parameters.
Run the simulation and observe the results.

Model Documentation:The project includes detailed documentation in the Documentation folder

Disclaimer:This model is a simplified representation of complex social dynamics. The results of the simulation should not be interpreted as definitive or conclusive.

Note:This revised version avoids mentioning or revealing the safety guidelines while still providing a comprehensive overview of the project.
